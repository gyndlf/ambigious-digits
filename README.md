## Ambigious digits in the MNIST dataset

Using a convolutional neural network, by analysing where it struggled the most to classify handwritten digits we can gain insight to the most ambigious digits in the dataset. Notebook `mnist_notebook.ipynb` steps through how to find these ambigious digits and the results are saved in `imgs` where the filename is the index of the image in the test data set.
